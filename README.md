## Assignment 6: HTML5 Forms

Create a new web page with a form to demonstrate the new HTML5 form features. Select a topic 
for your form and set appropriate fields.

* Include at least 5 of the new input types in your form

* Include a datalist with at least 5 options

* Include labels for all fields

* Use placeholder text in fields where appropriate (eg. has no initial value)

* Set one of the fields to have focus when the page is loaded

* Include a submit button (since we are not doing anything with it, just submit to #)

* Apply CSS with @media queries so that it looks good and is usable on desktop and mobile devices

As with previous assignments, once you have completed this assignment, show it to the instructor
in class.
